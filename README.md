# space\_rent

A little Rails app to help me and the people I share a practice space with keep track of when rent is due and how much each person owes.

## Features

* Keeps track of when rent is due and how much each person owes.
* Allows us to leave messages for each other.
* I might add a schedule to help coordinate practice space availability between different bands?
